# Store

Scripts written for [Bot Playground](./../Bots%20Playground.md) can be sold on the [SmartBots Bot Store](https://www.mysmartbots.com/store/section/scripts/).

You set the price, name, and description of your script — or choose to distribute it for free.\nPayments from sales go directly to your SmartBots Wallet.

# Script in Store

One of the demo scripts available in the Store looks like this:

 ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=98c54412-5830-47d8-adf1-f15b324d0834 " =1143x804")

With the following source code inside the Playground:

 ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=53fa67af-c61f-4c8d-a9a6-8410557c06f2 " =1106x410")

After purchasing, the script buyer attaches it to their bot, configures the required settings, and runs it.
