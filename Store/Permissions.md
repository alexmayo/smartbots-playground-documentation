# Permissions

Some script activities may be potentially dangerous for the user. Such activity includes:

* Sending money from the bot
* Sending IMs
* Teleporting the bot

You need to explicitly request such permissions. The user will be prompted to grant them while purchasing your script or when updating from a previous release that did not require these permissions.

Permissions are specified when creating a new release:
