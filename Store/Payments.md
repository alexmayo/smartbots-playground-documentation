# Payments

All the payments you earn from selling your Playground scripts go to your **SmartBots Wallet**.

# Commission

You receive **95%** of the payment. The SmartBots Store commission is **5%**.

# Earnings

You can check your Store earnings in your SmartBots account under **Business Tools → Your playground sales** page.

# Status

Playground earnings are deposited to your SmartBots immediately. However, these earnings are not available for withdrawal right away — they appear with an **ON HOLD** status.

Earnings become available **21 days** later (rounded up) to comply with the Refund Policy. After that, the earnings switch to a **RELEASED** status and become available for withdrawal.

# Withdrawal

Once funds are available, you can withdraw them to your SecondLife balance. Funds are processed in 1-2 hours from withdrawal request.

# Refund Policy

SmartBots Store scripts are subject to an unconditional **14-day refund** period. When a buyer requests a refund, the following happens:

* The purchased script is removed from the buyer's inventory.
* Money is returned to the buyer's balance.
* The seller's earnings record receives a **REFUNDED** status.

In some cases, refunds can be issued even beyond the 14-day period. The approval of such refunds is at the sole discretion of the SmartBots Support staff. Late refunds also reduce the seller's earnings records.

If your script cannot or should not be refunded (for example, it provides non-revocable assets or access), contact SmartBots Support to mark your item as **non-refundable**.
