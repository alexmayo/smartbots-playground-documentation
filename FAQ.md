# FAQ

## Is my bot's password safe? 

Yes. We do not store bot and SmartBots account passwords on a sandbox server at all.

## Can scripts read files? 

No. The scripts are sandboxed and can't access world outside the sandbox. However, check the "Bug Hunter" program below.

## Can other users access my scripts? 

Nobody can. However, check the [our Bug Hunter program](https://www.mysmartbots.com/dev/docs/Bot_Playground/Bug_Hunter_program "Bot Playground/Bug Hunter program").

## Selling your scripts

When someone my Playground script, do they have an access to the source code?

Not by default. You can set "show sources to the buyer" though.
